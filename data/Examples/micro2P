0. Derivation of

EG(Sat(heat))$7

All simplifications are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. Adding

  (EG0(z0)$z1 <=== z0 = Sat(heat) & z1 = 7)

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (EG(P)$st ===> P(st) & (EX(EG(P))$st | AX(false)$st))

at positions
[]
of the preceding trees leads to 

EG0(Sat(heat))$4

The reducts have been simplified in parallel.

2. Adding

  (EG0(z2)$z3 <=== z2 = Sat(heat) & z3 = 4)

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (EG(P)$st ===> P(st) & (EX(EG(P))$st | AX(false)$st))

at positions
[]
of the preceding trees leads to 

EG0(Sat(heat))$1 | EG0(Sat(heat))$3 | EG0(Sat(heat))$4

The reducts have been simplified in parallel.

3. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

EG0(Sat(heat))$3 | EG0(Sat(heat))$4

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified in parallel.

4. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

EG0(Sat(heat))$4

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified in parallel.
The formula coincides with no. 1

5. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

True

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified in parallel.
