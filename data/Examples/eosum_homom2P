0. Derivation of

State(st) ==> h(deltaEO(st)(x))(w) = deltaBeh(h(st))(x)(w)

All simplifications are admitted.
Simplification is safe.

1. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

(st = esum ==> h(deltaEO(esum)(x))(w) = h(esum)(x:w)) & 
(st = osum ==> h(deltaEO(osum)(x))(w) = h(osum)(x:w))

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

2. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

(st = esum ==> 
 h(esum)(w) = h(esum)(x:w) & even(x) | h(osum)(w) = h(esum)(x:w) & odd(x)) & 
(st = osum ==> h(deltaEO(osum)(x))(w) = h(osum)(x:w))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

8. Applying the axiom or theorem

even(x) | odd(x)

at positions
[0,1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

st = osum ==> odd(x) | even(x)

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

9. Applying the axiom or theorem

even(x) | odd(x)

at positions
[1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

True
