0. Derivation of

Nat(x) ==> even(x) | odd(x)

All simplifications are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. Adding

  (Nat0(x) ===> even(x) | odd(x))

to the axioms and applying INDUCTION wrt

  Nat(0)
& (Nat(suc(x)) <=== Nat(x))

at positions
[]
of the preceding trees leads to 

even(0) & All x:(Nat0(x) ==> even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x))) | 
odd(0) & All x:(Nat0(x) ==> even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x)))

The reducts have been simplified in parallel.

2. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x0:(Nat0(x0) ==> even(suc(x0)) | odd(suc(x0)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified in parallel.

3. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x0:(even(x0) ==> even(suc(x0)) | odd(suc(x0))) & 
All x0:(odd(x0) ==> even(suc(x0)) | odd(suc(x0)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified in parallel.

4. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x0:(even(x0) ==> odd(x0) | odd(suc(x0))) & 
All x0:(odd(x0) ==> even(suc(x0)) | odd(suc(x0)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified in parallel.
