0. Derivation of

p(f(x,y),z,0)

All simplifications are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

p(f(x,y),0,0) & z = 0

The reducts have been simplified parallel.
Failure atoms have been removed.

2. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

(p(0,0,0) & x = 0 & y = 0 | Any y1:((p(1,0,0) & x = suc(y1) & y = 0)) | 
 Any y1:((p(2,0,0) & y = suc(y1)))) & 
z = 0

The reducts have been simplified parallel.
Failure atoms have been removed.

3. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

(x = 0 & y = 0 | Any y1:((p(1,0,0) & x = suc(y1) & y = 0)) | 
 Any y1:((p(2,0,0) & y = suc(y1)))) & 
z = 0

The reducts have been simplified parallel.
Failure atoms have been removed.

4. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to
