0. Derivation of

Nat(x) ==> even(x) | odd(x)

All simplifications are admitted.
Narrowing forbids refutation.
Simplification forbids pure expansion.

1. The set of axioms is extended by

  (Nat0(x) ===> even(x) | odd(x))

Applying FIXPOINT INDUCTION wrt

  Nat(0)
& (Nat(suc(x)) <=== Nat(x))

at positions
[]
of the preceding trees leads to a single tree,
which is given by

(even(0) | odd(0)) & All x:((Nat0(x) ==> even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x))))

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

2. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x:((Nat0(x) ==> even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x))))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

3. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x:((even(x) ==> even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x)))) & 
All x:((odd(x) ==> even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x))))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

4. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x:((even(x) ==> odd(x) | odd(suc(x)))) & 
All x:((odd(x) ==> even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x))))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

5. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x:((odd(x) ==> even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x))))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

6. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

True

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
