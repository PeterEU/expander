0. Derivation of

EF(Sat(heat))$5

All simplifications are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. SIMPLIFYING in parallel the preceding trees (19 steps) leads to 

heat `in` [start,close,error] | any(MU X.(Sat(heat)\/EX(X)))[2,3] | 
heat `in` [] | heat `in` [start,close] | any(MU X.(Sat(heat)\/EX(X)))[7]

2. PERMUTING THE SUBTREES at positions
[]
of the preceding trees leads to 

any(MU X.(Sat(heat)\/EX(X)))[7] | heat `in` [start,close] | heat `in` [] | 
any(MU X.(Sat(heat)\/EX(X)))[2,3] | heat `in` [start,close,error]
The formula coincides with no. 1

3. SIMPLIFYING in parallel the preceding trees (9 steps) leads to 

True
