0. Derivation of

Nat(x) & State(st) ==> h(deltaEO(st)(x))(w) = deltaBeh(h(st))(x)(w)

All simplifications are admitted.
Simplification is safe.

1. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

Nat(x) & (st = esum | st = osum) ==> h(deltaEO(st)(x))(w) = h(st)(x:w)

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

2. DISTRIBUTING at positions
[0,0]
[0,1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

(Nat(x) & st = esum | Nat(x) & st = osum) ==> h(deltaEO(st)(x))(w) = h(st)(x:w)

3. SIMPLIFYING parallel the preceding trees (3 steps) leads to 

(st = esum & Nat(x) ==> h(deltaEO(esum)(x))(w) = h(esum)(x:w)) & 
(st = osum & Nat(x) ==> h(deltaEO(osum)(x))(w) = h(osum)(x:w))

4. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

(st = esum & Nat(x) ==> 
 h(esum)(w) = h(esum)(x:w) & even(x) | h(osum)(w) = h(esum)(x:w) & odd(x)) & 
(st = osum & Nat(x) ==> h(deltaEO(osum)(x))(w) = h(osum)(x:w))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

10. Applying the axiom or theorem

Nat(x) ===> even(x) | odd(x)

at positions
[1,0,1]
[0,0,1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

True

The reducts have been simplified parallel.
