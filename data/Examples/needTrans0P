0. Derivation of

(f(x,y),z) -> 0

All simplifications are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

(f(x,y),0) -> 0 & z = 0

The reducts have been simplified parallel.
Failure atoms have been removed.

2. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

((0,0) -> 0 & x = 0 & y = 0 | Any y1:(((1,0) -> 0 & x = suc(y1) & y = 0)) | 
 Any y1:(((2,0) -> 0 & y = suc(y1)))) & 
z = 0

The reducts have been simplified parallel.
Failure atoms have been removed.

3. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

(x = 0 & y = 0 | Any y1:(((1,0) -> 0 & x = suc(y1) & y = 0)) | 
 Any y1:(((2,0) -> 0 & y = suc(y1)))) & 
z = 0

The reducts have been simplified parallel.
Failure atoms have been removed.

4. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to
