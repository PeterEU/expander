0. Derivation of

even(x) ==> Any y:(x = 2*y)

All simplifications are admitted.
Narrowing forbids refutation.
Simplification forbids pure expansion.

1. The set of axioms is extended by

  (odd0(x) ===> Any y:(suc(x) = 2*y))

Applying FIXPOINT INDUCTION wrt

  (odd(suc(x)) <=== even(x))

at positions
[0,0,0]
of the preceding trees leads to a single tree,
which is given by

Any y0:((All x:((even0(x) ==> Any y:(suc(suc(x)) = 2*y))) & 0 = 2*y0))

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

2. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

Any y0 y:((2 = 2*y & 2*y0 = 0))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

3. SUBSTITUTING 0 FOR y0 at positions
[]
of the preceding trees leads to 

Any y:(2 = 2*y)

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

4. Applying the axiom or theorem

  2*1 = 2

at positions
[0,1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

True

The reducts have been simplified parallel.
