Derivation of

G(Error.head)$s ==> G(not(Heat).head)$s

Adding

  (G0(z0)$s <=== G(Error.head)$s & z0 = (not(Heat).head))
& (notG0(z0)$s ===> Not(G(Error.head)$s) | z0 =/= (not(Heat).head))

to the axioms and applying coinduction w.r.t.

  (G(P)$s ===> P(s) & G(P)$tail(s))

at position []
of the preceding formula leads to 

All s:(G(Error.head)$s ==> head(s) =/= 4) & 
All s:(G(Error.head)$s ==> head(s) =/= 7) & 
All s:(G(Error.head)$s ==> G0(not(Heat).head)$tail(s))

The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

All s:(G(Error.head)$s ==> head(s) =/= 7) & 
All s:(G(Error.head)$s ==> G0(not(Heat).head)$tail(s))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

All s:(G(Error.head)$s ==> G0(not(Heat).head)$tail(s))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the theorem

G0(z0)$s <=== G(Error.head)$s & z0 = (not(Heat).head)

at position [0,1]
