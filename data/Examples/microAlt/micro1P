Derivation of

G(Neg(Heat))(pa) | F(Neg(Error))(pa)

Shifting subformulas at position [1] of the preceding formula leads to 

Not(F(Neg(Error))(pa)) ==> G(Neg(Heat))(pa)

Narrowing the preceding formula leads to 

Not(Neg(Error)(pa)) & Not(F(Neg(Error))(tail(pa))) ==> G(Neg(Heat))(pa)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Removing subtrees at position [0,1] of the preceding formula leads to 

Not(Neg(Error)(pa)) ==> G(Neg(Heat))(pa)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula leads to 

Error(pa) ==> G(Neg(Heat))(pa)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Applying coinduction w.r.t.

  (G(P)(pa) ===> P(pa) & G(P)(tail(pa)))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

All pa:(Error(pa) ==> Neg(Heat)(pa))

The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the axiom or theorem

Neg(P)(pa) <=== Not(P(pa))

at position [0,1] of the preceding formula leads to 

All pa:(Error(pa) ==> notHeat(pa))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the axiom or theorem

Error(pa) <=== head(pa) `in` [2,5]

at position [0,0] of the preceding formula leads to 

All pa:(head(pa) = 2 ==> notHeat(pa)) & All pa:(head(pa) = 5 ==> notHeat(pa))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula leads to 

All pa:(head(pa) = 2 ==> head(pa) =/= 4) & 
All pa:(head(pa) = 2 ==> head(pa) =/= 7) & 
All pa:(head(pa) = 5 ==> notHeat(pa))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Replacing the subtrees at position [0,0,1,0] of the preceding formula leads to 

All pa:(head(pa) = 2 ==> head(pa) =/= 7) & 
All pa:(head(pa) = 5 ==> notHeat(pa))

The reducts have been simplified.

Replacing the subtrees at position [0,0,1,0] of the preceding formula leads to 

All pa:(head(pa) = 5 ==> notHeat(pa))

The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula leads to 

All pa:(head(pa) = 5 ==> head(pa) =/= 4) & 
All pa:(head(pa) = 5 ==> head(pa) =/= 7)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Replacing the subtrees at position [0,0,1,0] of the preceding formula leads to
