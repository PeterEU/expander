Derivation of

head(pa) `in` [4,6,7] & isPath(pa) ==> F(Heat)(pa)

Simplifying the preceding formula (3 steps) leads to 

(head(pa) = 4 & isPath(pa) ==> F(Heat)(pa)) & 
(head(pa) = 6 & isPath(pa) ==> F(Heat)(pa)) & 
(head(pa) = 7 & isPath(pa) ==> F(Heat)(pa))

The tree has been split.
The current formula is given by

head(pa) = 4 & isPath(pa) ==> F(Heat)(pa)

Applying the axiom or theorem

F(P)(pa) <=== P(pa) | F(P)(tail(pa))

at position [1] of the preceding factors leads to the factor

head(pa) = 4 & isPath(pa) ==> Heat(pa) | F(Heat)(tail(pa))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the axiom or theorem

Heat(pa) <=== head(pa) `in` [4,7]

at position [1,0] of the preceding factors leads to 2 factors.
The current factor is given by

head(pa) = 6 & isPath(pa) ==> F(Heat)(pa)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Heat(pa) | F(Heat)(tail(pa)) <=== head(pa) = 4 & isPath(pa)
F(Heat)(pa) <=== head(pa) = 4 & isPath(pa)

have been added as theorems.

The tree slider has been moved.
The current factor is given by

head(pa) = 7 & isPath(pa) ==> F(Heat)(pa)

Applying the axiom or theorem

F(P)(pa) <=== P(pa) | F(P)(tail(pa))

at position [1] of the preceding factors leads to the factor

head(pa) = 7 & isPath(pa) ==> Heat(pa) | F(Heat)(tail(pa))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the axiom or theorem

Heat(pa) <=== head(pa) `in` [4,7]

at position [1,0] of the preceding factors leads to a single formula,
which is given by

head(pa) = 6 & isPath(pa) ==> F(Heat)(pa)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Heat(pa) | F(Heat)(tail(pa)) <=== head(pa) = 7 & isPath(pa)
F(Heat)(pa) <=== head(pa) = 7 & isPath(pa)

have been added as theorems.

Applying the axioms

  (F(P)(pa) <=== P(pa) | F(P)(tail(pa)))
& (isPath(pa) ===> head(pa) -> head(tail(pa)))
& (isPath(pa) ===> isPath(tail(pa)))

at positions [1],[0,1] of the preceding formula leads to 

head(pa) = 6 & head(pa) -> head(tail(pa)) & isPath(tail(pa)) ==> 
Heat(pa) | F(Heat)(tail(pa))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Replacing the subtrees at position [0,1,0] of the preceding formula leads to 

head(pa) = 6 & 6 -> head(tail(pa)) & isPath(tail(pa)) ==> 
Heat(pa) | F(Heat)(tail(pa))

The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the axiom or theorem

6 -> 7

at position [0,1,0] of the preceding formula leads to 

head(pa) = 6 & 7 = head(tail(pa)) & isPath(tail(pa)) ==> 
Heat(pa) | F(Heat)(tail(pa))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the axiom or theorem

F(Heat)(pa) <=== head(pa) = 7 & isPath(pa)

at position [1,1] of the preceding formula leads to 

True

The reducts have been simplified.
