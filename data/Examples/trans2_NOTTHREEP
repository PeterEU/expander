0. Derivation of

NOTTHREE(st) & st `in` states ==> st = 1 | st = 3

All simplifications are admitted.
Narrowing forbids refutation.
Simplification forbids expansion.

1. SHIFTING SUBFORMULAS at positions
[0,1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

NOTTHREE(st) ==> (st `in` states ==> st = 1 | st = 3)

2. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

True

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.
