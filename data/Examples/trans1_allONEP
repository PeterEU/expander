0. Derivation of

all(ONE)[3,4]

All simplifications are admitted.
Narrowing forbids refutation.
Simplification forbids expansion.

1. SIMPLIFYING parallel the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

ONE(3) & ONE(4)

2. The set of axioms is extended by

  (ONE0(z0) <=== z0 = 3)
& (ONE0(z0) <=== z0 = 4)

Applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (ONE(st) ===> TWO/\(b#ONE)(st)) at positions
[]
of the preceding trees leads to a single tree,
which is given by

TWO(3) & ONE0(3) & TWO(4)

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

3. Applying the axioms

  (ONE0(z0) <=== z0 = 3)
& (ONE0(z0) <=== z0 = 4)

at positions
[1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

TWO(3) & TWO(4)

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

4. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

TWO(4)

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

5. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

TWO(3)

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

6. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

True

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.
