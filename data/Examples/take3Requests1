Derivation of

(take(3)$Requests1) = requests

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

(take(3)$Client1(0)$Server(Requests1)) = requests

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

Any b s':((0:(take(2)$Client1(b*2)$s')) = requests & Server(Requests1) = (b:s'))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

Any b s'0 b0:
 (Server(Requests1) = (b:(b0:s'0)) & 
  (0:((b*2):(take(1)$Client1(b0*2)$s'0))) = requests)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

Any b b0 s' b1:
 (Server(Requests1) = (b:(b0:(b1:s'))) & [0,b*2,b0*2] = requests)
