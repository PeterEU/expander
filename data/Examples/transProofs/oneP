Derivation of

all(one)[3,4]

Simplifying the preceding formula (3 steps) leads to 

one(3) & one(4)

Adding

  (one0(z0) <=== z0 = 3 | z0 = 4)
& (NOTone0(z0) ===> Not(z0 = 3) & Not(z0 = 4))

to the axioms and applying coinduction w.r.t.

  (one(st) ===> (two/\(b#one))(st))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

All st:(st = 3 | st = 4 ===> (two/\(b#one0))(st))

Simplifying the preceding formula (24 steps) leads to 

two(3) & two(4) & one0(3)

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

((a<>true)\/(b<>two))(3) & two(4) & one0(3)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.

Simplifying the preceding formula (3 steps) leads to 

two(4) & one0(3)

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

((a<>true)\/(b<>two))(4) & one0(3)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.

Simplifying the preceding formula (7 steps) leads to 

two(3) & one0(3)

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

((a<>true)\/(b<>two))(3) & one0(3)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.

Simplifying the preceding formula (3 steps) leads to 

one0(3)

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

3 = 3 | 3 = 4

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.

Simplifying the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

True
