Derivation of

all(three)[2,4]

Simplifying the preceding formula (3 steps) leads to 

three(2) & three(4)

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

(a#(atom(A)\/three))(2) & three(4)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

All st':((2,a) -> st' ==> (atom(A)\/three)(st')) & three(4)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.

Simplifying the preceding formula (9 steps) leads to 

three(4)

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

(a#(atom(A)\/three))(4)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

All st':((4,a) -> st' ==> (atom(A)\/three)(st'))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
