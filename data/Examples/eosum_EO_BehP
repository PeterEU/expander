0. Derivation of

State(st) ==> betaEO(st) = betaBeh(h(st))

All simplifications are admitted.
Simplification is safe.

1. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

(st = esum ==> betaEO(esum) = h(esum)[]) & 
(st = osum ==> betaEO(osum) = h(osum)[])

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

2. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

(st = esum ==> 1 = h(esum)[]) & (st = osum ==> betaEO(osum) = h(osum)[])

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

3. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

st = osum ==> betaEO(osum) = h(osum)[]

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

4. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

st = osum ==> 0 = h(osum)[]

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

5. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

True

The reducts have been simplified parallel.
