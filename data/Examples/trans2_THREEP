0. Derivation of

THREE(st) & st `in` states ==> st = 2 | st = 4

All simplifications are admitted.
Narrowing forbids refutation.
Simplification forbids expansion.

1. SHIFTING SUBFORMULAS at positions
[0,1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

THREE(st) ==> (st `in` states ==> st = 2 | st = 4)

2. The set of axioms is extended by

  (THREE0(st) ===> (st `in` states ==> st = 2 | st = 4))

Applying FIXPOINT INDUCTION wrt

  (THREE(st) <=== a#(sat(A)\/THREE)(st)) at positions
[]
of the preceding trees leads to a single tree,
which is given by

Not(THREE0(1))

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

3. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

True

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.
