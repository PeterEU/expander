0. Derivation of

LIST(s) ==> len(double(s)) = 2*len(s)

All simplifications are admitted.
Narrowing forbids refutation.
Simplification forbids pure expansion.

1. The set of axioms is extended by

  (LIST0(s) ===> len(double(s)) = 2*len(s))

Applying FIXPOINT INDUCTION wrt

  LIST[]
& (LIST(x:s) <=== LIST(s))

at positions
[]
of the preceding trees leads to a single tree,
which is given by

len(double[]) = 2*len[] & 
All x s:((LIST0(s) ==> len(double(x:s)) = 2*len(x:s)))

The reducts have been simplified parallel.

2. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

len[] = 2*len[] & All x s:((LIST0(s) ==> len(double(x:s)) = 2*len(x:s)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

3. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

0 = 2*len[] & All x s:((LIST0(s) ==> len(double(x:s)) = 2*len(x:s)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

4. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x s:((LIST0(s) ==> len(double(x:s)) = 2*len(x:s)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

5. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x s:((len(double(s)) = 2*len(s) ==> len(double(x:s)) = 2*len(x:s)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

6. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x s:((len(double(s)) = 2*len(s) ==> len(x:(x:double(s))) = 2*len(x:s)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

7. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x s:((len(double(s)) = 2*len(s) ==> len(x:double(s))+1 = 2*len(x:s)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

8. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All x s:((len(double(s)) = 2*len(s) ==> 2+len(double(s)) = 2*len(x:s)))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

9. NARROWING the preceding trees (one step) leads to 

All s:((len(double(s)) = 2*len(s) ==> 2+len(double(s)) = (2*len(s))+2))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified parallel.

10. REVERSING THE LIST OF TREES at positions
[0,1,1,0]
[0,1,1,1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

All s:((len(double(s)) = 2*len(s) ==> 2+len(double(s)) = 2+(2*len(s))))

11. DECOMPOSING THE ATOM at positions
[0,1]
of the preceding trees leads to 

All s:((len(double(s)) = 2*len(s) ==> len(double(s)) = 2*len(s)))

12. SIMPLIFYING parallel the preceding trees (2 steps) leads to 

True
